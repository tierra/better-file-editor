Adds line numbers, syntax highlighting, code folding, and lots more to the
theme and plugin editors in the admin panel.

== Description ==

Adds line numbers, syntax highlighting, code folding, and lots more to the
theme and plugin editors in the admin panel.

This plugin replaces the boring, clunky, and difficult to use theme and plugin
editor with a full-featured code editor using the Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor.

Requirements:

* Javascript Enabled (will use default editor if disabled)
* Browsers: Internet Explorer 9+, Chrome 15+, Firefox 3.6+, Safari 5.0+

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `better-file-editor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/`
   directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
